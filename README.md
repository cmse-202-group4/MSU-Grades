Hi! This is the repository for Group 4's CMSE 202 semester project. When making updates, please be sure to use descriptive comments of what you are commiting. Also, try to make sure no one else is working on the section that you plan on changing. As a rule of thumb, always pull before starting work, and commit your changes often!

Questions to answer:

x - Are some courses intrinsically easier?
x - Are some professors/TA's grading easier?
x - The honors and high honors awards go to the top 20 and 7% of the graduating class, respectively, is/how is that underrepresenting people in harder majors?

Project Goals:

x - Determine what courses/professors are easiest/hardest.
x - Determine trends in the data to identify grade inflation. (Look at this link, it shows a clear trend that GPAs are rising)(https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/GradHonor/GraduationHonors.aspx)
x - Create a visually friendly representation of these trends.
